KU Data Homework Unit 6


Conclusions:
In using the OpenWeather API and evaluting weather data based on latitude, the data does provide evidence of change based on the seasion within the latitude. Some items noted based on the data are:
* The starter example was from August 2018 vs where we pulled in February 2019, where you see a definite difference in maximum temperature in the temperature being further into the summer/winter season vs the spring/fall season where the temperatures moderate. 
* Humidity in the northern hemisphere seems to be higher to that in the southern. This may be due to the seasons and moisture (snow) in the north. The data shows what we know that the farther south you travel to the equator the drier is gets until you get into the tropics where you have clustered increase in humidity.
* The northern regions are seeing more cloudiness and it appears to go to extremes where some of the days appear to be cloudy (around 0) versus where a majority of the days are cloudy (80+%).
* The northern regions appear to have more wind, which could be tied to the winter month. An majority of the studied cities have wind around of less than 10mph, where there are few outliers in the 25+mph. Evaluating between the starter example from August 2018 to current February 2019, the wind changes appear to fluctuate based on the season.
